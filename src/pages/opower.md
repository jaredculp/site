# Opower

I basically owe everything in my career to this point to my colleagues and opportunities at Opower


As a team, we helped reduce global energy consumption by 31 terrawatt-hours (and counting!). That's the same as:
- Charging **2.7 billion** smartphones <span>ðŸ“±ðŸ”Œ</span>
- Changing **8.3 million** incandescent lightbulbs to LEDs <span>ðŸ’¡</span>
- Planting **363 million** plants for carbon capture <span>ðŸŒ³</span>


This has a direct impact on decarbonization to the tune of 15.2 million metric tons of CO2s. That's the same as:
- Not burning **16.7 billion** pounds of coal <span>ðŸ”¥</span>
- Taking **3.3 million** passenger vehicles off the road for an entire year <span>ðŸš—</span>


And I learned a hell of a lot along the way. Opower forever <span>ðŸ’™</span>.


In my last few years, I helped design and build the third generation of our flagship product, the Home Energy Report (HER). As of 2022, over **1,000,000,000** HERs have been sent across the world (via email and paper).

Because I'm a nerd for stats:
- Employed for **2748 days** (day 1: 2014-07-07)
- Wrote **6** company-wide RFCs
- Filed **936** and closed **1332** tickets in Jira
- **5,848** commits
- **3,162** pull requests
- Code merged into **24** github organizations across **252** repositories
- Modified **994,624** lines of code


Opower was [acquired by Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/pressrelease/oracle-buys-opower-050216.html) in 2017.
