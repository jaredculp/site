# Yo, I'm Jared. 👋🏻

Welcome to my cozy little space on the internet.

I go to [concerts](./concerts).
I read [books](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/jaredculp).
I [run](https://www.strava.com/athletes/29877893).
I root for the Eagles and UVA.
I also enjoy:
rubik's cubes,
[chess](https://lichess.org/@/jaredculp),
guitar,
golf,
and meditation.

I'm currently helping make mental healthcare more affordable and accessible [@grow-therapy](https://growtherapy.com) <span>🌱</span>.

Previously, I was a software engineer [@opower](./opower) <span>💡</span>, where we used behavioral, data, and computer sciences to drive energy efficiency.

I like to build silly little things like this [setlist generator](./setlist).
