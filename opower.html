    <h1>Opower</h1>

    <p>
      I basically owe everything in my career to this point to my colleagues and
      opportunities at Opower.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a team, we helped reduce global energy consumption by 31
      terrawatt-hours (and counting!). That's the same as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Charging <b>2.7 billion</b> smartphones <span>ðŸ“±ðŸ”Œ</span></li>
      <li>
        Changing <b>8.3 million</b> incandescent lightbulbs to LEDs
        <span>ðŸ’¡</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        Planting <b>363 million</b> plants for carbon capture <span>ðŸŒ³</span>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This has a direct impact on decarbonization to the tune of 15.2 million
      metric tons of CO2s. That's the same as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Not burning <b>16.7 billion</b> pounds of coal <span>ðŸ”¥</span></li>
      <li>
        Taking <b>3.3 million</b> passenger vehicles off the road for an entire
        year <span>ðŸš—</span>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      And I learned a hell of a lot along the way. Opower forever
      <span>ðŸ’™</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my last few years, I helped design and build the third generation of
      our flagship product, the Home Energy Report (HER). As of 2022, over
      <b>1,000,000,000</b> HERs have been sent across the world (via email and
      paper).
    </p>
    <p>Because I'm a nerd for stats:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Employed for <b>2748 days</b> (day 1: 2014-07-07)</li>
      <li>Wrote <b>6</b> company-wide RFCs</li>
      <li>Filed <b>936</b> and closed <b>1332</b> tickets in Jira</li>
      <li><b>5,848</b> commits</li>
      <li><b>3,162</b> pull requests</li>
      <li>Code merged into <b>252</b> repositories</li>
      <li>Modified <b>994,624</b> lines of code</li>
    </ul>
